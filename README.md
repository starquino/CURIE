CURIE - Comms Antenna Design: Simulation Files and Reports.

 

Simulation files (.cst) can be opened using CST STUDIO SUITE 2017®. When checking the simulation files, be sure to also download the accompanying folder (with matching filename), containing the 3D and schematic models, as well as the simulation results (S-Parameters, Farfield Results for Realized Gain, Directivity, etc.).



The folder titled "2018_Dec_10-Revised Designs" contains the latest design simulation files, as well as some GBR and STEP files exported for antenna manufacturing. Also, it contains some designs for installation considerations of the antennas on the CubeSat structure. 



The presented reports are organized in the "Reports" folder as PDF files, each with its corresponding date.
